The stylesheet "CheckRunArtifact.xsl" is a sample presentation for an artifact file
from a single run of a single check, in the context of the MetaAutomation
solution.

When the XML file from the check run (a check run artifact file) is opened in a
modern web browser, and the file "CheckRunArtifact.xsl" is present in the correct
relative directory, the browser will create at runtime a web page of the artifact
i.e. a presentation of the data.

The presentation shows the following elements:
*Title (hard-coded)
*The check name, taken from the check method name
*whether the check passed or failed
*the steps of the check shown in the step hiearchy, with status pass, fail, or blocked
*color-coding for check pass/fail status
*color-coding for check step pass/fail/blocked status
*time limit for each check step
*time elapsed for each check step (other than blocked steps, which didn't execute at all)
*check fail data from the innermost step that failed, including hierarchy from sub-checks

This demonstrates the flexibility of creating presentations of artifact data when
the artifact itself is pure, structured data with a schema, as with the Atomic Check
pattern of MetaAutomation.
